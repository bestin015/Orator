*"What we see in our sleep is considered as dreams"* that was my thought when I hear about dreams. But later I came to know that everything we see in our sleeps are not dreams but pieces of building blocks(mougts). Building mougts are different in different people but everyone have it. 
Building mougts are pieces of thought. Last night what we actively engaged in can remain in our thoughts as mougts. At the beginning these mougts arrange itself to please us or scare us. Pleasing and scaring depends on what our mind wants. 
Some mougts get stored in our memory when woke up. These past mougts collectively forms some images and it is called dreams. It can touch your heart beause it is a combination of your will, passion and ambition. It is mainly come at the end of the sleep. Beause it need time to form.
And finally God given mougts. When our soul get connected with spirit of God, some mougts generates. It talk to us like a optimum mentor. If we want to get God given mougts, our mind should be empty of sins. 
Dreams are full of potential. Balloon with hydrogen has potential to rise but a balloon without hydrogen has no potential but willing to get higher. Balloon with normal air can't rise high. Acquire dreams made of passion as hydrogen but give your thread to God or otherwise you don't have any destiny, may be you will get attacked by birds or you feel you are loosing the potential. Then God will pull back and again inflate you with potential. But only fly God given path. If you think that you have reached here, then you can achieve everything by yourself. Then God will release the thread.
Be aware of every decisions we make. Make use of Dreams.
